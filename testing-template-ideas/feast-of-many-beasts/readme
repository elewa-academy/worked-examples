Problem statement:
	All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

	Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.

	Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

Solution Design:
	1. Determine what parameter(s) the function needs to calculate an answer, as well as their type(s):
		• dish (string), beast (string)
	2. Determine what result the function will return,
	including the type:
		• whether the first and last letters match in each
	3. look at some test cases
		Test.assertEquals(feast("great blue heron", "garlic naan"), true)
		Test.assertEquals(feast("chickadee", "chocolate cake"), true)
		Test.assertEquals(feast("brown bear", "bear claw"), false)
	4. Determine the steps needed to calculate this re-
	sult:
	• compare first letters, compare last letters. return first_check && second_check
Implementation:
	1. Using the identified parameters, write the function header:
		function beast_feast(beast, dish) {
			let result;

			return result;
		}
	2. Using the identified steps, calculate the result:
		function beast_feast(beast, dish) {
			let result;

			let first_check = beast[0] == dish[0];
			let second_check = beast[beast.length] == dish[beast.length];

			return result;
		}
	3. Return the final result
		function beast_feast(beast, dish) {
			let result;

			let first_check = beast[0] == dish[0];
			let second_check = beast[beast.length] == dish[beast.length];

			result = first_check && second_check;

			return result;
		}
