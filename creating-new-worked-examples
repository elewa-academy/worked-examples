Problem statement:

Solution Design:
	1. Determine what parameter(s) the function needs to calculate an answer, as well as their type(s):
	2. Determine what result the function will return, including the type:
	3. look at some test cases:
	4. Determine the steps needed to calculate this result:

Implementation:
	steps and annotations

components analysis:
	variables used
		purpose
		initial value
		final value
	language features
		purpose
		behavior
	key chunks

behavior breakdown:
	by key chunks
		isolate them and use multiple values
		in separate functions?
	by variable
		how change over time and how it factors in
